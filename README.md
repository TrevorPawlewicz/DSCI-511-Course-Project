# DSCI 511: Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing

## _Term Project_: Song Data Mining

We will explore the area of music and lyrical content, possibly notes and chord progressions, to find trends in popular music.
We will ask if popular hit music (chart ranking and top selling songs) have trends in the following way:
- Are there common words and/or phrases?
- Are the common themes?
- Are there common notes and chords?
- Is there a structure in notes/chords that make certain moods?
