We will explore the area of music and lyrical content to find trends in popular music according to genre.
We will ask if popular hit music (chart ranking and top selling songs) have trends in the following way:
- Are there common words and/or phrases?
- Are the common themes?
- What words can be used in a specific genre to write a popular song lyric?

We would like to give developers a dataset to create phrases to help write a popular song in a specific genre.
