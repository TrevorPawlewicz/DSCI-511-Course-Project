For example, how will you get the notes and chords data, and how will they be incorporated with lyrics? Is each row of your dataset going to be a line of the lyrics or an entire song? Hammering these down will help you have a better idea of not only what data to collect, but also how large your final data size might be so you can also determine how you need to distribute the data – will you have to distribute access code, or will you be able to directly provide links to stored data.\n",
